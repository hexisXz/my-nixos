# my-nixos

This is my nixos system for my school, work, and coding.
It uses hyprland chromium (or firefox) and kitty


# how to install
``` sh
bla bla 
```

It actually doesn't have much and is pretty default even the hyprland config (but with a few changes). but i like it and it looks pretty good
